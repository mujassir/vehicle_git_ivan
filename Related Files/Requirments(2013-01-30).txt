Mujassir/Devin – The system is looking great so far. I am very pleased at the progress. We still have some work left to do. We need to wrap up the initial development. I want to do a soft launch to AT&T to gather feedback, make changes, then roll out a final version for a hard launch. I need to finish all outstanding work by this coming Friday in order to schedule a soft launch for AT&T mid next week. Afterwards, we will have time to make changes and schedule a final and hard launch of the site. Please read below. Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Due by Soft Launch
·         Ability to provide access

·         Ability to capture SMS reply in the vehicle service record using the phone number used to send SMS test message. (This is critical)

·         Change color scheme to match AIM Technical colors  (http://aimtechinc.com)

·         Change name to GPS Install Vehicle Management System and include AIM logo and AT&T logo (must request permission to use AT&T logo)

 
Due By Final and Hard Launch
 
·         Fine tune any bugs

·         Implement requested changes

·         Reporting – automated and emailed if possible

·         Recap Reporting

·         Billing Reporting (may be same as recap report?)

·         Suggestions for reports with analysis and performance benchmarking

·         Ensure the site is being used by techs on an ongoing basis
