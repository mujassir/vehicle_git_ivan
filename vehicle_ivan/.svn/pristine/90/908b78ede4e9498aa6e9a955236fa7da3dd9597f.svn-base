Hello Mujassir,
 
I was looking at the application and it is taking great form.
 
There are a few items I need to address however.
 
·         In the vehicle record there needs to be a “Phone Number” record area in between the “Serial Number”, and “Install type”

·         The record needs to find the matching “sent to phone number” in the sms log, and pull the responding data into the record.

·         When the admin logs into the application, we need to be able to view, add, edit, and delete users.

 
Thank you.
